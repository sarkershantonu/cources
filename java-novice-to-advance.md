# java-novice-to-advance

A Guide to Novice to Advance as Java Developer. 

# Know & Design app Classes/Objects/Enums/Interfaces
- override own equals and hashCode for own data/model classes
- override toString for good output
- Clone vs Deep clone 
- Define Interface & abstract class principles (why it should be a class/abstract/interface)
- Try to declear services/functionality with interfaces 
- Enum may contain constractors for multi purpose usages. 
- enum can have useful function to get info from member value
- Immutable object/class design
- Interface with default (java 8) 
- Marker interfaces
- Functional interfaces, default and static methods
- Abstract class vs Interface
- Final Class
- Anonymous classes
- Design Inheritance tightly coupled (abstract) or loosely coupled (interface)
- Data aggregation vs Composition (is or has a relationship) 


# Method Writing best practices 
- Immutable string/parameters (final in parameter)
- Avoid premptive type , use Java Class (Integer instead of int)
- use proper annotation 
- Avoid comments as much as you can, method names should be sef explanatory 
- Design type safe but generic method for multi purpose use. 
- try lambda for private methods(if accepted)
- Avoid system exception throwing , try business/custom exceptions based on design
- Anonymous method
- Final method

# Some Naming Convensions (detail in clean code boook) 
- maven group id(company Name)  & artifact id (project name) are small letters with dot 
- package names are small letters with dot  
- class, enum, interface or annotation names are PascalCase
- mthod, fields, variables are cammel case (some time method name is underscored like python)
- Static or Final fields are all CAPITAL. 
- enum values are all CAPITAL
- Generic Types are usually single capital letter. 

# Null Pointer best practices 
- Use Java 8 optional 
- compare with null==referece item (null before) 
- Compare with value==referece item (value before referece item)
- 

# Generics
- What is Generics? 
- Subtype/SuperType
- Logical Seperation of concern.
- What is generic type?
- How to declear? Method , Class , constractor, member variable of class. 
- what is Wildcat"?" 
- Why/When we use Wildcat or Generics type
- Example : 
       
       public <T extends InterfaceA > List<? extends Comparable<? extends T>> shortThis(List<? extends Comparable<? extends T>> items){
       .... }
